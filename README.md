# TechNow

TechNow is a tech blog that gives users (after logging in) the opportunity to make their own posts, comment on other posts, and see the posts they have made. 

Packages used:
* Express
* Express-handlebars
* Sequelize
* mySQL2

Although only a single route works from the homepage, I was happy to get a seeded set of tables (user, post, and a new table - comments).

Thanks
